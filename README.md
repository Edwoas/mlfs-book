# mlfs-book
O'Reilly book - Building Machine Learning Systems with a feature store: batch, real-time, and LLMs

# Lab 1
We download air quality data captured by a sensor from a busy street in Stockholm and predict what levels of PM 2.5 we will see in the coming days (based on this data). We use a feature group to inference our model and then plot a hindcast chart showing prediction (made one day beforehand) and ground truth. We also plot our predictions spanning multiple days ahead
